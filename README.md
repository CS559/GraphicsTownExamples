# Graphics Town Example

This is a fork of the master repository to which we will add some additional demonstrations.

You can see this workbook running at: https://cs559.github.io/GraphicsTownExamples/

The original master repository for Assignments 11 and 12 is: https://github.com/CS559/Workbook11-19-Master

Students are allowed to use the examples in their assignments (with proper attribution).

Things included beyond the original master repository:

- A Dynamic Environment Map (used to make a "shiny sculpture", see `Examples/shinySculpture.js`)
