# Graphics Town Example

This is a fork of the master repository to which we will add some additional demonstrations.

Students are allowed to use the examples in their assignments (with proper attribution).

Things included beyond the original master repository:

- A Dynamic Environment Map (used to make a "shiny sculpture", see `Examples/shinySculpture.js`)
